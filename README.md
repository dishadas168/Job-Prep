### 1. Upload Resume
In the "Upload Resume" section, users can upload their resume in PDF format. The application stores the document in a MongoDB database for easy access and retrieval.

### 2. Search Jobs
The "Search Jobs" section allows users to specify desired job roles and locations. The application utilizes a LinkedIn API to extract job descriptions, URLs, job details, and salary information. The results are displayed in a table format, and users can mark their application status with checkboxes, which are also saved to the database.

### 3. Generate Resume
The "Generate Resume" section lets users customize their resume according to the job description. Users simply paste the job description, click submit, and receive a tailored resume in DOCX format. This document can be downloaded and edited as needed.

### 4. Generate Cover Letter
In the "Generate Cover Letter" section, users can create a customized cover letter based on the job description. The application generates a cover letter in DOCX format, which users can download and further customize.

### 5. Applications
In the "Applications" section, users can view the jobs they've applied for. This provides a convenient overview of their job application history.
